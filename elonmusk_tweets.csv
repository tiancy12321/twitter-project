387,elonmusk,"@spideycyp_155 @PPathole @ashleevance It has required a lot of our resources. Going into super lockdown mode slows down new development progress, as we have to resist attacks from a sophisticated adversary actively at war."
388,elonmusk,"@ashleevance DoD provided about 3% of the Falcon 1 development cost. Appreciated, certainly, but should be seen in context."

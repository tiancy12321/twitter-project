996,elonmusk,"2 main goals this year: 

- Starship to orbit
- FSD wide release

Many other things, of course, but those are the 2 giant kahunas. Will require insane work by many super talented people, but, if anyone can do it, they can. 

It is an honor to work with such awesome human beings."
997,elonmusk,It is the fastest way to get between one downtown and another with known physics (and the Standard Model is proving quiet resilient)!

This early version of 10.69 is being extra cautious, so waits for a moderately big gap in traffic to cross. Upcoming releases will do better in heavy traffic."

Current price will be honored for orders made before Sept 5th, but delivered later."

10.69.1 probably end of week with wider release.

1069.2 in a few weeks should be good enough to provide to all FSD Beta participants."

1951,elonmusk,"@LouDobbs I do try my hardest to be good and sometimes I fear that untrue negative stories about me may cause others to excuse their bad behavior to their conscience, because they think I‚Äôm doing it too, but I‚Äôm not!"
1952,elonmusk,"@LouDobbs I know some of the people you mention and I think they‚Äôre good, but for sure not all billionaires are good, since we are dealing with humans after all."

1954,elonmusk,"@westcoastbill It was 96% in favor of me, until I commented. Ironically, there might be more left-wing bots following me than right-wing haha."
1955,elonmusk,@IheartTesla @Tesla V true
1956,elonmusk,@EvaFoxU Yes
1957,elonmusk,Great potential to lift people out of poverty. Providing Internet is teaching people to fish.
1958,elonmusk,One Starlink can provide Internet for an entire school of hundreds of students

1977,elonmusk,@EvaFoxU Hmm
1978,elonmusk,@JacobB1290H Will discuss this and other improvements with Tesla audio engineering. The new Model S and X sound system is incredible.
1979,elonmusk,"Ya know, it‚Äôs pretty damn great to be able to talk to people from all walks of life and many countries on Twitter!

So much to be learned, even from the harshest critics. 

Basically ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm just saying I love all you crazy people ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è"
1980,elonmusk,Many insightful comments in the mentions
1981,elonmusk,@westcoastbill For sure
1982,elonmusk,"@uniteCOforus @thebradfordfile Yeah, I think that‚Äôs probably right. If it were up to me, I would delete charitable deduction. And class-action lawsuits."
1983,elonmusk,@wanda_hudson @TomFitton @AJDelgado13 I think this would actually work
1984,elonmusk,"@TheTeslaBull @BLKMDL3 @S3XYstarship @IWill_Travel @AOC Based on past experience, about 12 to 18 months. Companies that are inherently negative cash flow (ie value destroyers) need to die, so that they stop consuming resources."
1985,elonmusk,@andymilonakis Fair
1986,elonmusk,@SmileSimplify @AOC I‚Äôm genuinely curious
1987,elonmusk,"@BLKMDL3 @S3XYstarship @IWill_Travel @AOC Yes, but this is actually a good thing. It has been raining money on fools for too long. Some bankruptcies need to happen.

Also, all the Covid stay-at-home stuff has tricked people into thinking that you don‚Äôt actually need to work hard. Rude awakening inbound!"
1988,elonmusk,@StrategistSpace @IWill_Travel @AOC That would be awesome
1989,elonmusk,"@S3XYstarship @IWill_Travel @AOC This would be a super bad idea, since stocks can swing wildly from one day to the next, eg Snapchat dropping 43%. Tesla is ~40% below ATH!

However, eliminating estate tax dodges like GRATs would be good, since probability of kids being effective stewards of capital is lower."
1990,elonmusk,"@IWill_Travel @AOC The degree to which the unions control the Dems is insane. It‚Äôs like watching a sock puppet ‚Äútalk‚Äù, but the hand inside the sock is way too obvious!"
1991,elonmusk,.@aoc I dare you to run the same poll with your followers
